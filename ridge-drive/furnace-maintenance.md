# Furnace Filter Maintenance

The furnace filter is the small unit on the floor that looks like
a PC.  It is blue and has a black power chord plugged into the front of it. 

There are 2 indicators on the front panel.  One is an indicator for the 
pre-filter and the other one (more of a vertical bar) is for the filter. 
If either of these show red then it's time to vacuum out the filter. 

The steps from the manual are:

- Turn the power off and wait for all the lights to dim.
- Unplug the power chord
  - The chord connects a lot like the old telephone jacks did
  - There's a piece underneath it that you need to squeeze in order to pull it out 
- Remove the door
  - There are 2 black knobs to turn on the left hand side.  
    - The top one turns down
    - The bottom one turns up
- The pre-filters make up the unit on the left hand side.
  - They should pull right out but remember there are 2 of them in series. 
- The filter itself is the unit on the far right.  
- Basically you need to remover everything in order to both the pre-filter and the filter. 
  - If necessary, take a picture of the filters before you pull them out just so you remember the order
- Use a shop vac on the pre-filters and the filter
  - Make sure to do both sides
- Re-install the filter and pre-filters the same way the came out.
- Re-install the front panel / door.
  - There are 2 notches (upper and lower) that need to line up for the door to go in correctly
- Reconnect the power chord.
  - The jack goes in with the extra piece you need to squeeze at the bottom. 
- Hold the reset button for about 5 seconds 
  - It should come up clean with no red lights
