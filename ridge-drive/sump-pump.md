# Sump Pumps

## Overview
The sump pump system has a primary and secondary pump and is configured such that the secondary pump will take over if the primary fails.

## Failover Config
This is due to the primary pump being positioned lower in the well.  The secondary pump sits on a cinder block about 8" higher than the primary pump.  The idea is that the secondary pump's float will only engage if there was a failure in the primary pump.  

## Electrical Config
The sump pump system is connected to the electrical panel that gets used if there's a power failure, so it should always be on.  It's designated as a critical electrical system to the house. 

## Installment Positioning
The primary pump is on the right hand side as you face the house, and the float should face inward towards the yard.  

The secondary pump is on the left hand side as you face the house, and the float should face outwards, towards the house.  

The reason for the specific positioning has to do with aligning the pumps to the different lengths of the connecting pumps sticking out at the top.  The primary PVC pipe is shorter than the secondary.

## Weep Hole 
Near the bottom of the PVC pipes exists a pre-drilled weep hole about 3/8" in diameter to prevent the pipe from getting airlocked and the pump running dry.  When the pump runs it may look like leakage of some sort, but it's very much intentional.
