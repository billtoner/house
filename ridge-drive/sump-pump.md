# Sump Pump

## Overview
The sump pump system has a primary and secondary pump and is configured such that the secondary pump will take over if the primary fails. 

The sump pump system is connected to the electrical panel that gets used if there's a power failure, so it should always be on.  It's designated as a critical system to the house. 

## Installment
The primary pump is on the right hand side as you face the house, and the float should face inward towards you.  The secondary pump is on the left hand side as you face the house, and the float should face towards the house.  The reason for this has to do with aligning the pumps to the two different lengths of the connecting pumps at the top.  If the pumps aren't facing the right direction, the pumps will still connect, but they will look "crooked."
